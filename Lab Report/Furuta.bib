abstract = {This paper deals with certain options on controlling an inverted rotary pendulum also known as the Furuta pendulum. Controlling an inverted pendulum involves two stages. The first stage is the swing up of the pendulum and the second stage is its balancing in the up-right position. The paper describes two possibilities on swinging up the pendulum. First one is the classical approach based on comparing the current total (potential and kinetic) energy of the system with the energy in its stabilized up-right position. The second option uses an exponentiation operation over the pendulum position since the trend of power law function is very convenient for determining the amount of required energy to be delivered to the system. For the purposes of balancing the pendulum in the up-right position a predictive controller based on optimal control law with perturbation was proposed, which is an LQ controller with control signal corrections when constraints are exceeded. The results are illustrated by real-time experiments on a laboratory rotary inverted pendulum setup.},

@article{Cazzolato2011,
abstract = {The Furuta pendulum, or rotational inverted pendulum, is a system found in many control labs. It provides a compact yet impressive platform for control demonstrations and draws the attention of the control community as a platform for the development of nonlinear control laws. Despite the popularity of the platform, there are very few papers which employ the correct dynamics and only one that derives the full system dynamics. In this paper, the full dynamics of the Furuta pendulum are derived using two methods: a Lagrangian formulation and an iterative Newton-Euler formulation. Approximations are made to the full dynamics which converge to the more commonly presented expressions. The system dynamics are then linearised using a Jacobian. To illustrate the influence the commonly neglected inertia terms have on the system dynamics, a brief example is offered.},

@article{Chhabra2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014, {\textcopyright} 2014 Taylor {\&} Francis.In recent years, there have been concerns in the UK regarding the uptake of particular subjects in post-compulsory education. Whilst entries for Advanced level (A-level) subjects such as media studies have experienced considerable growth, entries for A-level physics have, until recently, been declining, prompting fears of a skills crisis in future generations. This study applied an established psychological theory, the theory of planned behaviour, to explore the drivers behind students' subject choice at A-level, specifically focusing on students' intentions to study physics and media studies. Multiple regression analyses supported the predictive validity of the theory in this context, with the three predictor variables (attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control) accounting for 66{\%} of the variance in students' intentions to study physics and 68{\%} of the variance in students' intentions to study media studies. Furthermore, for both subjects, attitude and subjective norm were found to be significant predictors of intentions. Hence, students with higher intentions to study physics or media studies exhibited a more positive attitude towards choosing this subject and perceived greater social pressure from significant others. Analysis of the beliefs underlying students' subject choices suggested that the influence of parents was particularly important to students, as were beliefs about the positive outcomes of choosing physics or media studies in terms of student's future career and education prospects. This suggests that initiatives aimed at increasing the uptake of subjects such as physics in the future might be best targeted in these areas.},

abstract = {In this paper, is used the Lagrangian classical mechanics for modeling the dynamics of an underactuated system, specifically a rotary inverted pendulum that will have two equations of motion. A basic design of the system is proposed in SOLIDWORKS 3D CAD software, which based on the material and dimensions of the model provides some physical variables necessary for modeling. In order to verify the results obtained, a comparison the CAD model simulated in the environment SimMechanics of MATLAB software with the mathematical model who was consisting of Euler-Lagrange's equations implemented in Simulink MATLAB, solved with the ODE23tb method, included in the MATLAB libraries for the solution of systems of equations of the type and order obtained. This article also has a topological analysis of pendulum trajectories through a phase space diagram, which allows the identification of stable and unstable regions of the system. {\textcopyright} Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Swing-up control of a single pendulum from the pendant to the upright position is firstly surveyed. The control laws are comparatively studied based on swing-up time from a given initial state to the upright position. The State Dependent Riccati Equation is found effective for designing the swing-up control law under saturating control input. The control law is extended to a linear combination of sine function of the angle and the angular velocity, and a variable structure control with a sliding mode given by the linear combination. Making the swing-up time correspond to a colour, which is similar to the Fractal analysis, colour maps of the swing-up time for given control parameters and initial conditions yield interesting Fractal-like figures.},
